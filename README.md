# FINDINE

Findine is a restaurant suggestion web application with Tinder-like mechanics. Users can provide constraints such as cost, maximum travel distance, dietary options (vegetarian, gluten free, allergies, etc), or personal preferences, and the web application will then present users with suggestions. Users can anonymously swipe to like or dislike the restaurant
suggestions of their choice. In the couple example, user A can pair with user B in order
to find the “matching” restaurant. Once both users A and B have swiped like for the
same restaurant, this will trigger a notification / event where users are shown there is a
match on where they will be having meals.
